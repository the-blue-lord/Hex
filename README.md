# Hex
This is a repositiroy for an HTML version of the game called Hex.

The game Hex, also knowkn as Nash, was created by Piet Hein in 1942. It is traditionally played on an 11Ã—11 rhombus board.

The board is composed of hexagons (from wich the name) wich in this HTML version of the game were substituted with squares. Each player is assigned a pair of opposite sides of the board, which they must try to connect by alternately placing a stone of their color onto any empty cell. Once placed, the stones are never moved or removed.

A player wins when they successfully connect their sides together through a chain of adjacent stones.
